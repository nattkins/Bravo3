title: About Migrations
excerpt: If you think they shouldn't be so hard then we agree.

The problem with migrations is that it's one word containing a multitude of interpretations; for example, it might be any combination of the following:

* A chance to ditch the old tech
* A Mandate from 'on-high.'
* A corporate rebranding exercise
* A cover for corporate reorganization
* Part of a governmental reprioritization
* Mandated change in 'government machinery.'
* An excuse to spend budget that would otherwise not get spent 
* A chance to forget past mistakes/past corporate trauma 

It's clear to us that migrations mainly begin their journey to Fail when the goals are vague or too numerous. Maybe this point will seem obvious, but if you don't have a goal or can't pick them out of a line-up, then by definition, you can't win! . Once on your journey to Fail try a handful of these assumptions to make things really go wrong:
* Users won't change their way of working because 'people hate change.'
* Users won't need teaching as the tools are all so user-friendly.
* Users will have to change to the new way of doing things - because we're taking away the old ways.
* The platform we're using is very flexible; we can and will code our way out of any difficulties.
* Users will teach themselves; there is a whole internet out there.

The successful journey, on the other hand, is quite simple.

1. Get a vision; it will be a metaphor for what you want to have happen.
1. Share the vision widely and be clear what its realization will look, sound and feel like.
1. Work with technologies and people that grasp the vision and can deliver it.
