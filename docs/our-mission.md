## Our Mission
We believe that this virus has proved something that we knew along- that people want to spend their time with the people that matter and doing work that matters. And so at Bravo Criteria, we want to provide you with the means to enhance collaboration, promote creativity and make work more rewarding and purposeful. And we'll use digital technologies, ways of working and beneficial thinking strategies to achieve this. 

### So that means working remotely, right?

Absolutely, but if you try to remote work just like you always did before, you've missed a great opportunity. In-person meetings don't translate well into remote working because there was so much going on that we just took for granted:
* Turn-taking and related mind reading tricks
* You can change the venue to suit during the meeting, outside on warm days, across the street over coffee, over lunch (stop It! I'm getting * weepy) 
* Bumping into people, how many essential meetings happened for you in the corridor on the way somewhere else?
* Meetings while walking (one of my prefered ways to discuss ideas)
* Collaboratively working on a whiteboard - with working pens, I would kill for a really good remote solution that did all a good whiteboard could do.
* Impromptu meetings (in the pub)
* Talking to someone at their desk 
* Floor walking 
* Using actual props to explain concepts, I am a big fan myself of sugar and sachets, coffee cups and spoons to explain concepts.

## But there is an opportunity too?

Definitely - remote means that you can pretty much do all those things AND some that you have never tried you only have to be more conscious about it.
